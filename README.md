#  Molecular Simulation Design Framework (MoSDeF) tutorial 

This notebook contains all the code presented in the tutorial video on how to use MosDEF to generate data files containing interaction parameters (force field) of a molecule of interest using only it's SMILES string. The data files are generate for LAMMPS simulation the documentations includes intructions on how to generate the data file for GROMACS, HOOMD-Blue, and GPU-Optimized MOnte Carlo (GOMC).

# Preparing conda enviroment

Conda-forge does not come as a default package in conda, so we need to add it first just in case.

`conda config --add channels conda-forge` <br>
`conda config â€“-set channel_priority strict`


Now, create a conda enviroment from the env.yaml. You can change the name of the enviroment changing the first line of the yaml file.

`conda env create -f env.yaml`


# Tutorial 
 
Open the MosDEF_Tutorial Notebook to learn how to generate data file for molecular simulations using the OPLS-AA force field in LAMMPS, GROMACS, etc. This code can be used to generate force field parameters and configurations files for systems of interts at specified densities. Run the LAMMPS simulations to compleate the tutorial.


# Challenges and prizes

Generate a Lammps data file for liquid systems of the molecules presented in the notebook and equilibrate their volume for 20 ns. Calcualte the average density and error of your simulations and post your resulst on the comments of the video.
